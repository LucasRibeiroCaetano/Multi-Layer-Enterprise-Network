# Multi-Layer-Network

![Network Topology](./Topology.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Multi-Layer-Network** is a simulated enterprise-grade infrastructure designed to integrate both Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies. The network spans multiple branches (Engineering, Health, Agriculture, etc.), each connected through routing protocols and VLAN segmentation.

This project reflects a real-world campus network with full subnetting, security mechanisms, and service deployments. It showcases protocol integration (RIP, OSPF), switching concepts, and end-to-end connectivity.

## Key Concepts & Technologies

- **Layer 2 (Switching):**
  - VLANs, PVLANs
  - RSTP
  - VTP (Transparent and Server Modes)
  - Port Security
  - BPDU Guard / Filter
  - Root Guard / Loop Guard

- **Layer 3 (Routing):**
  - RIP (main routing protocol)
  - OSPF (for MPLS AToM simulation)
  - Static routes for service support
  - Multilink PPP over Frame Relay

- **Security & Access Control:**
  - ACLs
  - SSH access on L3 switches and routers
  - PPP PAP/CHAP authentication

- **Services:**
  - NAT
  - DHCP
  - Subnetting for all branches
  - Internet Simulation via RE-1 router

## Equipment Emulated

- **Routers:** `i86bi-linux-l3-adventerprisek9-15.4.1T.bin`
- **Switches (L2 & L3):** `i86bi-linux-l2-adventerprisek9-ms.SSA.high_iron_20190423`

---

## Implementation Notes

- Layer 3 switches are used as root bridges in a segmented fashion for better load balancing.
- PPP PAP was implemented between intermediary routers due to simulator limitations.
- MPLS AToM is configured but not functional due to limitations in reachability beyond RE-1.
- Full ping connectivity inside the topology was tested successfully.
